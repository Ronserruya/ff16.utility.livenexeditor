#1.0.2  
* Improved folder selection in configuration  
* Made the delay before saving changes configurable (thx @Xeeynamo)  
* Added an option to try editing even if the sql files were generated with an incompatible version of FF16Tools
* Fixed the sql teardown, so all the internal tables/triggers made to the sql db should be deleted when the game closes
